## Your first React component

* Create me a Navbar the "React Way"
    * Go to Codepen.io => create a new Pen
    * Go to Settings => Tab "JS"
        * Preprocessor: Set "Babel"
        * Add external Scripts
            * Search first for "react" and add it
            * Search for "react-dom" and add it
        * Click Save & Close
    * Start coding!
        * Create a little navigation component with three entries
    * Do NOT use these strange "props" (if I introduced you to them). Just hardcode the three nav entries into your component please and send me your pen private on slack
